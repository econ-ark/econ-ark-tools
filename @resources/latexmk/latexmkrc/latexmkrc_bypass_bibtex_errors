# Google 'latexmk' for explanation of this config file
# 
# This configuration bypasses latexmk's problematic internal bibtex error detection
# while still providing the same compilation functionality.
# 
# The issue: latexmk 4.83 has internal 'run_bibtex' logic that detects errors
# independently of the external bibtex command's exit code and output.
# 
# The solution: Disable latexmk's bibtex integration ($bibtex_use = 0) and 
# rely on the existing .bbl files that are generated by the build scripts.

$bibtex_use = 0;                # Disable latexmk's bibtex integration
$pdf_mode = 1;                  # Generate PDF output
$force_mode = 1;                # Force compilation even with warnings
$warnings_as_errors = 0;        # Don't treat warnings as errors

# Note: This configuration assumes that .bbl files are generated separately
# by the build scripts using the bibtex wrapper, which works perfectly.
# The wrapper handles duplicate entry suppression correctly.
