# latexmkrc-for-html
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This is a general-purpose latexmk configuration tuned for build processes
#   that require maximum verbosity, such as debugging complex documents or
#   preparing for an HTML conversion pipeline (e.g., using `make4ht`).
#
#   Its primary feature is disabling silent mode (`$silent = 0;`), which causes
#   all output from the underlying LaTeX commands to be printed to the console.
#
# USAGE:
#   This configuration can be invoked for any document with the -r flag:
#   `latexmk -r path/to/latexmkrc-for-html my_document.tex`
#
# --- SETTINGS ---

# --- Core Behavior ---
# The main purpose of this file: be as verbose as possible.
$silent = 0;

# --- Compilation Control ---
$force_mode = 1;          # Force compilation to continue through routine warnings.
$warnings_as_errors = 0;  # Do not treat warnings as fatal errors.
$pdflatex_runs = 3;       # A sufficient number of runs for most documents.
$do_cd = 1;               # Always change to the document's directory before compiling.
$pdf_mode = 1;            # Ensure PDF mode is active.

# --- BibTeX Specifics ---
$bibtex_use = 2;                    # Ensure bibtex is run when needed.
$bibtex_silent_switch = '-terse';   # Reduce bibtex verbosity.

# --- Logging & Reporting ---
$rc_report = 1;           # Report which rc file is being used at startup.
$aux_out_dir_report = 1;  # Report where auxiliary files are being placed.

# --- File Cleanup ---
# Define a minimal set of extensions to be deleted by `latexmk -c`.
$clean_ext = "bbl nav out snm tmp 4tc 4ct log fls fdb_latexmk synctex.gz ps lg";

# --- Engine Command ---
# Standard command for running pdflatex in non-interactive CI/build environments.
$pdflatex = "pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode %O %S";

# NOTE: This file is now a general-purpose tool. It does not contain any
# project-specific filenames and will operate on whichever .tex file is
# passed to latexmk on the command line.
