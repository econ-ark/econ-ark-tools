# bibtex_wrapper.sh
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This script acts as a wrapper around the real `bibtex` command. It is
#   designed to solve a specific, notorious problem with `latexmk`: `latexmk`
#   will often halt compilation if it sees "Repeated entry" warnings in
#   BibTeX's output, even if these warnings are harmless.
#
#   This wrapper intercepts the output from BibTeX. If the *only* issues are
#   "Repeated entry" warnings, it completely suppresses them and reports a
#   clean success (exit code 0) to `latexmk`. It does this by filtering the
#   console output and rewriting the .blg log file to remove all traces of
#   the duplicate entry warnings.
#
#   If any other, more serious errors are detected (e.g., missing database
#   files, undefined citations), it passes them through, ensuring that
#   genuine problems are still reported.
#
# USAGE:
#   Called automatically by a latexmkrc file configured to use it as the
#   `$bibtex` command.
# ---

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
# Find the full path to the bibtex executable.
# Using `command -v` is a robust, POSIX-compliant way to find an executable in the PATH.
REAL_BIBTEX_CMD=$(command -v bibtex)

# Check if bibtex was found. If not, exit with an informative error.
if [ -z "$REAL_BIBTEX_CMD" ]; then
    echo "FATAL ERROR: 'bibtex' command not found in your system's PATH." >&2
    echo "Please ensure a TeX distribution is installed and its 'bin' directory is in your PATH." >&2
    exit 1
