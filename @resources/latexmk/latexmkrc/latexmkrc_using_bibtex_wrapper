# latexmkrc_using_bibtex_wrapper
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This configuration tells latexmk to use our custom-built bibtex wrapper
#   script. The wrapper is designed to intelligently suppress "Repeated entry"
#   warnings that latexmk's internal logic often mishandles.
#
# USAGE:
#   This file is not meant to be used alone. It should be included in a parent
#   latexmkrc file via the `do` command, like so:
#   do 'path/to/latexmkrc_using_bibtex_wrapper';
#
# See: bibtex_wrapper.sh for the wrapper's implementation.
# ---

# Use single quotes for the path to prevent Perl from interpreting '@' as an array.
# This is the correct and safe way to specify the path.
$bibtex = 'sh ./@resources/latexmk/latexmkrc/tools/bibtex_wrapper.sh %O %B';

# Setting `$bibtex_use = 2` tells latexmk that a .bbl file is needed and
# that it should be generated if it's missing or outdated.
$bibtex_use = 2;
