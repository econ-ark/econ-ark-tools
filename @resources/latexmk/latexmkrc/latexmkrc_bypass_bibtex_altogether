# latexmkrc_bypass_bibtex_altogether
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This configuration completely disables latexmk's built-in BibTeX integration.
#   It is designed for workflows where the .bbl file is generated reliably by an
#   external script (e.g., our `bibtex_wrapper.sh`), but latexmk's
#   internal error-checking is still causing the compilation to fail.
#
#   By setting `$bibtex_use = 0`, we instruct latexmk to assume that a valid
#   .bbl file already exists and to proceed with the `pdflatex` runs without
#   trying to invoke bibtex itself.
#
# USAGE:
#   This file should be used in build scripts where you need to guarantee that
#   latexmk will not interfere with a pre-generated .bbl file.
