Configuration details:

0. The screensaver and lock-screen features are turned off by default
   * Fix this, if desired, using the control panel at the upper left
0. The machine is configured with only one username: econ-ark
   * The password is the username spelled backwards
0. This machine is highly insecure
   * Do not store important personal information on it

Several tools for communicating with the machine are installed

0. An ssh server is installed and operating
   * You should be able to connect via a command like:
      * `ssh econ-ark@[your-VM-IP-Address]` using the usual password
0. There is a [vnc](https://en.wikipedia.org/Virtual\_Network\_Computing) server installed and operating 
   * This enables viewing the VM's screen from another computer 
   * You will need VNC viewer client software to do so 
   * You can disable the VNC viewer (for security):
      * Comment out the first couple of lines of `/home/econ-ark/.bash_aliases`
0. The `avahi` networking software is also installed
