# Restoring from a timeshift backup is tricky
# Here we assume the simplest case:
# 0. The device to be restored to has the same partitioning structure
# 0. That device can boot on its own before the restore
# 0. The target partition has enough space
# 0. There is a 'junk' partition to which unneeded stuff is restored

# CDC setup with two identical USB sticks:
# original (to be restored) on /dev/sda
# backup (from which restore) on /dev/sdb

# Full noninteractive command should be something like:
timeshift --rsync --restore --scripted --yes --grub /dev/sdb1 --snapshot-device /dev/sdb2 --snapshot '2022-07-31 17-15-23' --target /dev/sda2

# Just running timeshift --restore from the CLI will prompt for responses
