Different ways to construct a self-contained Econ-ARK machine:

#### [Virtual](https://github.com/econ-ark/econ-ark-tools/blob/master/Virtual)

* Create a Virtual Machine that you can run on a host computer. Because your computer's resources will be shared with the VM, both your regular processes (email, etc) and the Econ-ARK machine's processes may be slow.

#### [Metal](https://github.com/econ-ark/econ-ark-tools/tree/master/Machine/Metal)

* Take an existing computer and set it up so it can boot the Econ-ARK system on an external drive or flash stick. 
      * Your machine will be faster and more efficient than the Virtual option. 

#### [Hybrid/Cloud](https://github.com/econ-ark/econ-ark-tools/blob/master/Metal)

* Convert an existing platform running Debian/Ubuntu into the Econ-ARK machine.
